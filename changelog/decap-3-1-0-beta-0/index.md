The main feature of this release is the upgrade to React 18. This is a large change with potential side effects, so we decided to release a beta version.

We kindly invite everyone to test, especially Gatsby users, who were most eagerly awaiting this update. If you find any new issues, please report them as [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/decaporg/decap-cms/issues).
